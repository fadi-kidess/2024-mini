Exercise 1: For this exercise, we read the print value of `adc.read_u16()` while covering and shining a light on the sensor to estimate the max and min brightness. After we input the estimate max/min_bright, then we used 1 to subtract from the `duty_cycle` and print the value. Hence, when it's at max brightness, it reads as 1 and when it's min brightness, it reads as 0.
1. max_bright = 45000, min_bright = 5500

Exercise 2: In this exercise, we input a series of frequencies and durations that match the tones of twinkle twinkle little star using the note frequency chart provided.
